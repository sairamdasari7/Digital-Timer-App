Description:
This project is a digital timer web application built using React.js. It features a user interface that displays the elapsed time in minutes and seconds, along with buttons to start/pause the timer, reset it, and set the timer limit.

The main components of this project are:

DigitalTimer Component: This component manages the state of the timer, including whether it's running or paused, the elapsed time, and the timer limit. It provides functionality to start/pause the timer, reset it, and adjust the timer limit.

Timer Display: The elapsed time is displayed in a visually appealing format, with the minutes and seconds separated and styled accordingly.

Controls: Users can control the timer using buttons to start/pause, reset, and set the timer limit. The buttons are styled and responsive.

Timer Limit Controller: Users can adjust the timer limit (in minutes) using buttons to increase or decrease the value. The timer limit controls are visually presented and disabled when the timer is running.

The project utilizes CSS for styling, with responsive design considerations for different screen sizes. The timer logic and state management are handled within the DigitalTimer component, demonstrating the use of class components in React. Overall, this project provides a user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring time.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
